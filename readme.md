Review of elevational gradients in ant diversity for *Insectes Sociaux*  
=======================================================================  
Last update: 2015 Feb 19  
  
This review covers elevational gradients in ant diversity across the globe. 
The data were compiled from the literature; only those meeting *a priori* criteria were used to ensure standardized, comprehensive sampling of the elevational gradient. 
The scope and focus of this review is currently being decided.  
  
The goal is to have the entire process on git.
