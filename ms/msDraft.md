# I. Introduction  
## History or value of elevational studies generally  
Blah blah. 
  
## Value of studying insects  
Despite comprising the majority of animal species **CITE**, insects have not received much focus in macroecological studies [@DF2010]. 
However, the astonishing array of insect diversity suggests that no picture of biodiversity would be complete without insects. 
Furthermore, understanding the processes underlying insect diversity may yield valuable insights into the processes that shape patterns biodiversity more broadly. 
Ants have a number of advantages to global studies of diversity. 
As predators, competitors, scavengers, and dispersers, they have major ecological impacts in a wide variety of systems [@HollWils1990]. 
In contrast to many insect taxa, the individuals used for identification are wingless, restricting their movement from the nest and reducing the impact of accidentals. 
Additionally, because of the historic interest in ants across many decades **CITE**, there is a firmer baseline for comparisons across time and ants have been relatively well-described taxonomically. 
Nevertheless, we know little about the ranges and less about the basic natural history of many species **CITE**[@Lanan2014]. 
  
## Challenge  
Understanding the patterns/distribution/characteristics of biodiversity necessitates a comprehensive, global perspective. 
Here, I review the previous work on ant richness and communities along elevational gradients across the globe. 
Then, using well-sampled elevational datasets, I investigate patterns of ant richness and beta diversity across taxonomic resolutions. 
Finally, I explore how ant nesting habits and dietary specialization varies across elevations. 
  
  
# II. Datasets  
## Literature search  
To identify ant elevational distribution datasets at local spatial scales, I performed a literature search with Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar, using combinations of the keywords 'ant', 'elevation\*', 'altitud\*', 'gradient', 'diversity', and 'insect'. 
This search primarily returned studies along discrete elevational transects with sampling sites interspersed along the gradient. 
To identify ant elevational distribution datasets at regional spatial scales, I searched for publications with 'ants of' in the title. 
This search returned guides to the ant fauna of a particular geopolitical region. 
Such guides typically compile museum records and collections from many years spread across the region, detailing the recorded occurrences of each ant species in the region. 
The elevational range of each ant species was interpolated. 
That is, each species was assumed present between the lowest and highest occurrence within a dataset. 
  
## Sampling criteria  
To restrict the analysis to robust, well-sampled datasets, I required that a dataset provide ant elevational data within a mountainous region or along a gradient and meet five *a priori* criteria: 
(1) sufficient, even sampling effort with standardized methods across the gradient; 
(2) sampling of at least 70% of the gradient; 
(3) sampling within the lowest 400m of the gradient; 
(4) no elevational sampling gaps greater than 500m; and 
(5) relatively little anthropogenic disturbance. 
These criteria, adapted from previous studies [@McCain2009; @McCain2010], are required to ensure the accurate description of the naturally occurring pattern [@McCoy1990; @McCoy2002; @McCain2005b; @Rahbek2005; @NB2008].
The common richness patterns, however, differ primarily across the lower portion of the elevational gradient [@NB2008]. 
Consequently, violations of the second criterion were allowed when the majority of the unsampled region was at high elevations where declining richness had been demonstrated. 
  
## Study descriptions    
A total of 68 candidate datasets were found (Appendix). 
A number of publications used data from the literature, leaving 47 unique datasets that detailed ant distributions or richness within a single region or along a gradient. 
There were 20 that met all five *a priori* sampling criteria, and 16 of those provided species-level elevational range data. 
Thus, the majority of published studies describing ant richness across elevations did not employ sampling regimes sufficient to confidently capture the underlying richness pattern. 
Nevertheless, the robust datasets included local and regional scales, tropic and temperate zones, mainland and island gradients, and wet and arid climates (Appendix). 
  
## Pattern definitions  
I classified the ant elevational richness and beta diversity into five categories using definitions from the literature (Fig. 1; [@McCain2009; @McCain2010]. 
In decreasing patterns, diversity is highest at the lowest elevation and declines steadily with increasing elevation. 
In low plateau patterns, diversity is consistently high across at least the lowest 300m before declining monotonically. 
Mid-peaks show highest diversity >300m from the mountain base and with at least 25% greater diversity than at the base. 
In increasing patterns, diversity increases with elevation. 
U-shaped patterns show highest diversity toward the base and summit, with depressed diversity at intermediate elevations. 
No pattern was recorded when none of these definitions were met and the richness showed no consistent pattern across elevations. 
Though more patterns are possible [@McCain2009], the datasets here were characterized well by these five patterns.  
  
  
# III. Taxonomic richness patterns  
## Species richness  
In the robust datasets, ant species richness most often peaks at intermediate elevations (14/20), though decreasing (3/20) and low plateau (3/20) patterns also occur (Fig. 1). 
Regional and local scale datasets showed nearly identical species richness pattern distributions. 
In the excluded datasets, the patterns were more variable. 
In addition to the mid-peaks, decreases, and low plateaus seen in the robust datasets, there were also gradients with increasing richness and no identifiable richness pattern. 
Furthermore, decreasing patterns were nearly as common as mid-peaks in the excluded datasets. 
Some of these decreasing patterns, however, are likely an artefact of sampling bias. 
The majority did not sample within the lowest 400m, potentially failing to capture the portion of the gradient across which the common patterns differ the most. 
Ant species richness, therefore, shows a variety of elevational patterns, with richness often highest at intermediate elevations. 
  
## Genus richness  
In the 16 robust datasets with species-level elevational ranges, the number of genera across elevations typically mirrors the number of species, and the number of species increases quite predictably with the number of genera (stats: lme?). 
Genus richness peaks at or below the elevation with the highest species richness. 
The most speciose genus in each dataset comprises 7–31% of the total species richness along the gradient (mean ± SE: 0.200 ± 0.0157). 
Elevationally, the dominance of the most speciose genus varies considerably both within and among gradients. 
As elevation increases, the proportion of species within the most speciose genus may increase (5/16), decrease (4/16), remain constant (4/16), peak at intermediate elevations (2/16), or increase to a plateau (1/16). 
Nevertheless, the species richness pattern of the most speciose genus is generally similar to the richness pattern of the remaining species. 
That is, the most speciose genus does not appear to drive the overall richness pattern. 
The elevation with highest species richness does, however, tend to coincide with the richness peak of the most speciose genus. 
Therefore, though the general species richness pattern is not driven by one genus, some specific aspects may be. 
  
## Subfamily richness  
The number of ant subfamilies shows less distinct patterns elevationally than the number of species or the number of genera. 
The most speciose subfamily along each gradient comprises 39–73% of the total species richness (mean ± SE: 0.545 ± 0.0204). 
The proportion of species in the most speciose subfamily is highly variable across elevations and the pattern is not consistent among gradients. 
Across elevations, that proportion may be constant at low and middle elevations and then increase toward the peak (4/16), remain constant across the gradient (3/16), increase consistently across the gradient (3/16), increase to a plateau (3/16), remain constant at low and middle elevations and then decrease toward the peak (2/16), or be U-shaped (1/16). 
Generally, the most speciose subfamily is distributed more broadly (GET RANGE DATA) and persists in higher elevations than species in the other subfamilies. 
As with species richness patterns in the most speciose genus, the species richness patterns of the most speciose subfamilies tend to be remarkably similar to both the overall species richness pattern and the richness pattern of the remaining species. 
The elevational species richness pattern does not result from the richness pattern of the most speciose subfamily. 
The richness patterns within the non-dominant subfamilies is less clear due to the lower total number of species. 
However, the subfamilies with enough species tend to follow the same overall trend as the total species richness pattern.

# Beta Diversity  
In a broad sense, beta diversity is quantifies the variation in the species composition across space or time [@Anderson2011]. 
Species composition can vary, however, due to either the substitution of one species for another, called *turnover*, or due to the loss or addition of species, called *nestedness* [@Baselga2010; @Baselga2012; @Legendre2014]. 
Differences in turnover and nestedness suggest variation in the ecological processes underlying the community composition. 
To explore the change in ant communities across elevational gradients, I used the Sørensen-family metrics in the R package *betapart* to calculate the overall beta diversity, turnover, and nestedness between adjacent sites along each gradient [@Baselga2010; @Baselga2012; @BaseOrme2012]. 
These indices allow for unbiased comparisons among communities of differing richness [@Baselga2012]. 
I calculated each component using the species composition, genus composition, and subfamily composition at each elevation.
