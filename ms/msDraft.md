# Introduction  
Two to three paragraphs. 
Nice and short. 
Wait until draft is more complete to set the context. 
Not done trying to listen to the data yet. 
Possibilities:  
## History or value of elevational studies generally  

  
## Value of studying insects  
Despite comprising the majority of animal species (@CITE), insects have not received much focus in macroecological studies (@DF2010). 
However, the astonishing array of insect diversity suggests that no picture of biodiversity would be complete without insects. 
Furthermore, understanding the processes underlying insect diversity may yield valuable insights into the processes that shape patterns biodiversity more broadly. 
Ants have a number of advantages to global studies of diversity. 
As predators, competitors, scavengers, and dispersers, they have major ecological impacts in a wide variety of systems (@HollWils1990). 
In contrast to many insect taxa, the individuals used for identification are wingless, restricting their movement from the nest and reducing the impact of accidentals. 
Additionally, because of the historic interest in ants across many decades (@CITE), there is a firmer baseline for comparisons across time and ants have been relatively well-described taxonomically. 
Nevertheless, we know little about the ranges and less about the basic natural history of many species (@CITE; @Lanan2014). 
  
## Challenge  
Understanding the patterns/distribution/characteristics of biodiversity necessitates a comprehensive, global perspective. 
Here, I review the previous work on ant richness and communities along elevational gradients across the globe. 
Then, using well-sampled elevational datasets, I investigate patterns of ant richness and beta diversity across taxonomic resolutions. 
Finally, I explore how ant nesting habits and dietary specialization varies across elevations. 
  
  
# Datasets  
## Literature search  
To identify ant elevational distribution datasets at local spatial scales, I performed a literature search with Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar, using combinations of the keywords 'ant', 'elevation\*', 'altitud\*', 'gradient', 'diversity', and 'insect'. 
This search primarily returned studies along discrete elevational transects with sampling sites interspersed along the gradient. 
To identify ant elevational distribution datasets at regional spatial scales, I searched for publications with 'ants of' in the title. 
This search returned guides to the ant fauna of a particular geopolitical region. 
Such guides typically compile museum records and collections from many years spread across the region, detailing the recorded occurrences of each ant species in the region. 
The elevational range of each ant species was interpolated. 
That is, each species was assumed present between the lowest and highest occurrence within a dataset.  
  
  
## Sampling criteria  
To restrict the analysis to robust, well-sampled datasets, I required that a dataset provide ant elevational data within a mountainous region or along a gradient and meet five *a priori* criteria: 
(1) sufficient, even sampling effort with standardized methods across the gradient; 
(2) sampling of ≥70% of the gradient; 
(3) sampling within the lowest 400m of the gradient; 
(4) no elevational sampling gaps >500m; and 
(5) relatively little anthropogenic disturbance. 
These criteria, adapted from previous studies (@McCain2009; @McCain2010), are required to ensure the accurate description of the naturally occurring pattern (@McCoy1990; @McCoy2002; @McCain2005; @Rahbek2005; @NB2008).
The common richness patterns, however, differ primarily across the lower portion of the elevational gradient (Fig. 1). 
Consequently, violations of the second criterion were allowed when the majority of the unsampled region was at high elevations where declining richness had been demonstrated. 
  
  
## Study descriptions    
A total of 68 candidate datasets were found (Appendix). 
A number of publications used data from the literature, leaving 47 unique datasets that detailed ant distributions or richness within a single region or along a gradient. 
There were 20 that met all five *a priori* sampling criteria, and 16 of those provided species-level elevational range data. 
Thus, the majority of published studies describing ant richness across elevations did not employ sampling regimes sufficient to confidently capture the underlying richness pattern. 
Nevertheless, the robust datasets included local and regional scales, tropic and temperate zones, mainland and island gradients, and wet and arid climates (Appendix). 
  
  
## Pattern definitions  
I classified the ant elevational richness into five categories using definitions from the literature (Fig. 1; @McCain2009; @McCain2010). 
In decreasing patterns, richness is highest at the lowest elevation and declines steadily with increasing elevation. 
In low plateau patterns, richness is consistently high across at least the lowest 300m before declining monotonically. 
Mid-peaks show highest richness >300m from the mountain base and with at least 25% greater diversity than at the base. 
In increasing patterns, diversity increases with elevation. 
No pattern was recorded when none of these definitions were met and the richness showed no consistent pattern across elevations. 
More patterns are possible (@McCain2009), but the datasets here were characterized well by these five patterns.  
      
# Taxonomic richness patterns  
## Species richness  
In the robust datasets, ant species richness most often peaks at intermediate elevations (14/20), though decreasing (3/20) and low plateau (3/20) patterns also occur (Fig. 1). 
Regional and local scale datasets showed nearly identical richness pattern distributions.

A variety of patterns have been observed, though mid-elevational peaks are most common.
