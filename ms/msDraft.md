# Introduction  
Two to three paragraphs. 
Nice and short. 
Wait until draft is more complete to set the context. 
Not done trying to listen to the data yet. 
Possibilities:  
## History or value of elevational studies generally  
## Main patterns  
## Value of studying insects  
  
  
# Datasets  
## Literature search  
To identify ant elevational distribution datasets at local spatial scales, I performed a literature search with Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar, using combinations of the keywords 'ant', 'elevation*', 'altitud*', 'gradient', 'diversity', and 'insect'. 
This search primarily returned studies along discrete elevational transects with sampling sites interspersed along the gradient. 
To identify ant elevational distribution datasets at regional spatial scales, I searched for publications with 'ants of' in the title. 
This search returned guides to the ant fauna of a particular geopolitical region. 
Such guides typically compile museum records and collections from many years spread across the region, detailing the recorded occurrences of each ant species in the region. 
The elevational range of each ant species was interpolated. 
That is, each species was assumed present between the lowest and highest occurrence within a dataset.  
  
  
## Sampling criteria  
To restrict the analysis to robust, well-sampled datasets, I required that a dataset provide ant elevational data within a mountainous region or along a gradient and meet five *a priori* criteria: 
(1) sufficient, even sampling effort with standardized methods across the gradient; 
(2) sampling of ≥70% of the gradient; 
(3) sampling within the lowest 400m of the gradient; 
(4) no elevational sampling gaps >500m; and 
(5) relatively little anthropogenic disturbance. 
These criteria, adapted from previous studies (@McCain2009; @McCain2010), are required to ensure the accurate description of the naturally occurring pattern (@McCoy1990; @McCoy2002; @McCain2005; @Rahbek2005; @NB2008).
The common richness patterns, however, differ primarily across the lower portion of the elevational gradient (Fig. 1). 
Consequently, violations of the second criterion were allowed when the majority of the unsampled region was at high elevations where declining richness had been demonstrated. 
  
## Study descriptions    
A total of 68 candidate datasets were found (Appendix). 
A number of publications used data from the literature, leaving 47 unique datasets that detailed ant distributions or richness within a single region or along a gradient. 
There were 20 that met all five *a priori* sampling criteria, and 16 of those provided species-level elevational range data. 
Thus, the majority of published studies describing ant richness across elevations did not employ sampling regimes sufficient to confidently capture the underlying richness pattern. 
Nevertheless, the robust datasets included local and regional scales, tropic and temperate zones, mainland and island gradients, and wet and arid climates (Appendix).

A variety of patterns have been observed, though mid-elevational peaks are most common.
