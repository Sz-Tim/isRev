# Introduction  
To disentangle the factors that shape species richness, it is essential to first thoroughly explore the patterns of richness [@Rahbek1995; @Lomolino2001]. 
Elevational gradients provide useful study systems to investigate these patterns and drivers [@McCain2009; @McCain2010]. 
Mountains, occurring on every continent, act as compact, globally replicated systems that vary across many characteristics that may drive richness, including climate, history, and geography [@Rahbek1995; @Lomolino2001; @McCaGryt2010]. 
Detailing how communities change across elevational gradients, and across taxonomic levels, can yield insight into the underlying processes shaping biodiversity at a broad scale. 
  
Despite comprising the majority of animal species, insects have not received much focus in such macroecological studies [@DF2010]. 
However, with the astonishing array of insect diversity, no picture of biodiversity would be complete without including insects. 
Furthermore, understanding the processes underlying insect diversity may yield valuable insights into the processes that shape patterns biodiversity more broadly. 
Ants have a number of advantages for global studies of diversity. 
As predators, competitors, scavengers, and dispersers, they have major ecological impacts in a wide variety of systems [@HollWils1990]. 
In contrast to many insect taxa, the individuals used for identification are wingless, restricting their movement from the nest and reducing the impact of accidentals. 
Additionally, because of the historic interest in ants across many decades **CITE**, they have been relatively well-described taxonomically and there is a firmer baseline for comparisons across time. 
Nevertheless, we know little about the ranges and less about the basic natural history of many species [@Lanan2014]. 
  
Understanding the distribution of biodiversity necessitates a comprehensive, global perspective. 
Here, I review the work to date on ant richness and communities along elevational gradients across the globe. 
Then, using well-sampled elevational datasets, I investigate patterns of ant richness and beta diversity across taxonomic resolutions. 
Finally, I explore patterns of the elevational ranges of ant species. 
  
  
# Datasets  
To identify ant elevational distribution datasets at local spatial scales, I performed a literature search with Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar, using combinations of the keywords 'ant', 'elevation\*', 'altitud\*', 'gradient', 'diversity', and 'insect'. 
This search primarily returned studies along discrete elevational transects with sampling sites interspersed along the gradient. 
To identify ant elevational distribution datasets at regional spatial scales, I searched for publications with 'ants of' in the title. 
This search returned guides to the ant fauna of a particular geopolitical region. 
Such guides typically compile museum records and collections from many years spread across the region, detailing the recorded occurrences of each ant species in the region. 
The elevational range of each ant species was interpolated. 
That is, each species was assumed present between the lowest and highest occurrence within a dataset. 
  
To restrict the analysis to robust, well-sampled datasets, I required that a dataset provide ant elevational data within a mountainous region or along a gradient and meet five *a priori* criteria: 
(1) sufficient, even sampling effort with standardized methods across the gradient; 
(2) sampling of at least 70% of the gradient; 
(3) sampling within the lowest 400m of the gradient; 
(4) no elevational sampling gaps greater than 500m; and 
(5) relatively little anthropogenic disturbance. 
These criteria, adapted from previous studies [@McCain2009; @McCain2010], are required to ensure the accurate description of the naturally occurring pattern [@McCoy1990; @McCoy2002; @McCain2005b; @Rahbek2005; @NB2008].
The common richness patterns, however, differ primarily across the lower portion of the elevational gradient [@NB2008]. 
Consequently, violations of the second criterion were allowed when the majority of the unsampled region was at high elevations where declining richness had been demonstrated. 
   
A total of 68 candidate datasets were found (Appendix). 
A number of publications used data from the literature or sampled geographically disparate sites, leaving 47 unique datasets that detailed ant distributions or richness within a single region or along a gradient. 
There were 20 that met all five *a priori* sampling criteria, and 16 of those provided species-level elevational range data. 
Thus, the majority of published studies describing ant richness across elevations did not employ sampling regimes sufficient to confidently capture the underlying richness pattern. 
Nevertheless, the robust datasets included local and regional scales, tropic and temperate zones, mainland and island gradients, and wet and arid climates (Appendix). 
  
I classified the ant elevational richness and beta diversity into five categories using definitions from the literature (Fig. 1)[@McCain2009; @McCain2010]. 
In decreasing patterns, diversity is highest at the lowest elevation and declines steadily with increasing elevation. 
In low plateau patterns, diversity is consistently high across at least the lowest 300m before declining monotonically. 
Mid-peaks show highest diversity >300m from the mountain base and with at least 25% greater diversity than at the base. 
In increasing patterns, diversity increases with elevation. 
U-shaped patterns show highest diversity toward the base and summit, with depressed diversity at intermediate elevations. 
No pattern was recorded when none of these definitions were met and the richness showed no consistent pattern across elevations. 
Though more patterns are possible [@McCain2009], the datasets here were characterized well by these five patterns.  
  
  
# Elevational range size  
### Variation among gradients  
The mean ant species elevational range is larger in the regional datasets than in the local scale datasats (STATS). 
The mean elevational range is also larger in temperate zones (STATS), consistent with other taxa [@Janzen1967; @Ghalambor2006; @McCain2009b]. 
However, this may partly be an artifact of the total gradient height. 
In fact, in the temperate datasets, the mean range size as a proportion of the gradient height in regional datasets is indistinguishable from the mean in local datasets. 
However, mean range size is significantly smaller in tropical local datasets both absolutely and as a proportion of the gradient. 
In particular, this seems to be driven by a large proportion of species detected at just one elevation (STATS). 
The only tropical dataset at a regional scale showed a large mean range size with both methods, though as there is only one such dataset and it is from an island [@SarnEcon2012], no generalities can be drawn. 
Absolute mean range size increases with distance from the equator (STATS). 
However, scaled by the gradient size, a hump-shaped pattern emerges, with range size increasing with latitude in local datasets and decreasing with latitude in regional datasets. 
  
### Variation along gradients  
Ant elevational range size does not increase with elevation universally. 
Using the Steven's method [@McCaBrac2012; @Stevens1992], where the mean range size at each elevation is calculated as the mean elevational range of all species detected at that elevation, mean range size increases significantly with elevation in 9/16 datasets. 
The fit was high among these datasets (*r^2^* mean: 0.82, median: 0.89), which included both regional and local scales as well as temperate and tropical gradients. 
However, 7/16 datasets showed either no consistent change in mean range size with elevation or, in one case [@Fisher1998], a declining trend.

# Species composition & beta diversity  
In a broad sense, beta diversity quantifies the variation in the species composition across space or time [@Anderson2011]. 
Species composition can vary, however, due to either the substitution or replacement of one species for another, called *turnover*, or due to the loss or addition of species, called *nestedness* [@Baselga2010; @Baselga2012; @Legendre2014]. 
Turnover and nestedness are likely driven by different processes and understanding the the pattern of each across elevations may yield insight into the importance of ecological filtering, biotic interactions, and neutral processes **CITE**[@Svenning2011]. 
Differences in turnover and nestedness suggest variation in the ecological processes underlying the community composition. 
To explore the change in ant communities across elevational gradients, I used the Sørensen-family metrics in the R package *betapart* to calculate the overall beta diversity, turnover, and nestedness between adjacent sites along each gradient [@Baselga2010; @Baselga2012; @BaseOrme2012]. 
These indices allow for unbiased comparisons among communities of differing richness [@Baselga2012]. 
I calculated each component using the species composition, genus composition, and subfamily composition at each elevation. 
  
### Species  
At the species-level, overall beta diversity between adjacent elevations is most often U-shaped (13/16), though it may also increase (2/16) or remain constant (1/16) across the gradient. 
In these datasets, therefore, the change in species composition is generally lowest at middle elevations and greatest toward the summit or the base. 
Along most gradients (12/16), most of the change is due to nestedness rather than turnover and turnover is, in fact, quite low (STATS). 
The exceptions to this pattern are all in the tropics. 
For instance, in Madagascar [@Fisher1998] and the Philippines [@Samson1997], overall beta diversity is high across the gradient, driven largely by the replacement of species across elevations. 
This is consistent with the small elevational ranges of many ant species along gradients in the tropics (mean~temperate~ ± SE: 652m ± 68, mean~tropic~ ± SE: 381m ± 44; *t~13.5~* = 2.99; *P* = 0.01; figure?). **OUT OF PLACE** 
The higher species turnover along these tropical gradients suggests a possible role of biotic interactions in the species composition across elevations. 
**JANZEN** 
Along the majority of the gradients, however, nestedness dominates, consistent with the role of abiotic factors in determining the species composition. 
  
### Genus  
Overall beta diversity between adjacent elevations at the genus-level is most commonly U-shaped (14/16), often with a low elevation truncation such that highest beta diversity occurs at high elevations. 
In the Philippines [@Samson1997] and Costa Rica [@LongColw2011], beta diversity increases monotonically across elevations. 
Turnover at the genus-level is typically lower than at the species-level. 
Along many gradients, genus turnover is nearly zero across the majority of elevations and the change in genus composition is instead due to nestedness. 
The primary exceptions are in the Philippines [@Samson1997], where turnover is higher than nestedness except at the highest elevations and increases to a peak at mid-to-upper elevations, and in the McPherson Range in Australia [@BurwNaka2011], where turnover decreases monotonically and is overtaken by nestedness at middle elevations. 
With common interpretations of turnover and nestedness **CITE**, the high nestedness and low turnover along most gradients suggest that environmental filtering is more important than biotic interactions in determining the ant genus community across elevations. 

### Subfamily    
At the subfamily level, overall beta diversity is low between adjacent elevations. 
There is no turnover in the subfamily composition in any of the datasets. 
Rather, all changes between adjacent elevations are due to nestedness as subfamilies are added or lost. 
Nestedness, and consequently overall beta diversity, commonly increases toward high elevations (12/16), though in some cases it is U-shaped (3/16) or high at the mountain base (1/16). 
Thus, there is a high degree of elevational overlap across subfamilies, and subfamilies are progressively excluded as elevation increases, likely due to environmental filtering. 
With vanishingly little subfamily turnover, there is little evidence for competitive exclusion at the subfamily level. 
  
### Comparison across taxonomic levels  
Beta diversity decreases as taxonomic resolution decreases. 
That is, species dissimilarity is higher than genus dissimilarity between adjacent elevations (stats for *Beta~genus~* and *Beta~species~*) which, in turn, is higher than subfamily dissimilarity (stats for *Beta~subfamily~* and *Beta~genus~*). 
Turnover declines most dramatically at higher taxonomic levels and is essentially non-existent between ant subfamilies. 
Even in the tropical datasets, where species turnover is highest, the genus turnover is substantially lower. 
This is consistent with competitive exclusion between congeners across elevations, though heightened sensitivity to abiotic conditions and consequent elevational specialization could also produce this pattern. 
Nevertheless, high species turnover is not universal among the tropical gradients and turnover is consistently low in the temperate datasets.

# Dominant taxa  
### Most speciose genus  
The most speciose genus in each dataset comprises 7–31% of the total species richness along the gradient (mean ± SE: 20.0 ± 1.57%). 
Elevationally, the dominance of the most speciose genus varies considerably both within and among gradients. 
As elevation increases, the proportion of species within the most speciose genus may increase (5/16), decrease (4/16), remain constant (4/16), peak at intermediate elevations (2/16), or increase to a plateau (1/16). 
Nevertheless, the species richness pattern of the most speciose genus is generally similar to the richness pattern of the remaining species. 
That is, the most speciose genus does not appear to drive the overall richness pattern. 
The elevation with highest species richness does, however, tend to coincide with the richness peak of the most speciose genus. 
Therefore, though the general species richness pattern is not driven by one genus, some specific aspects may be. 
  
### Most speciose subfamily  
The most speciose subfamily along each gradient comprises 39–73% of the total species richness (mean ± SE: 54.5 ± 2.04%). 
The proportion of species in the most speciose subfamily is highly variable across elevations and the pattern is not consistent among gradients. 
Across elevations, that proportion may be constant at low and middle elevations and then increase toward the peak (4/16), remain constant across the gradient (3/16), increase consistently across the gradient (3/16), increase to a plateau (3/16), remain constant at low and middle elevations and then decrease toward the peak (2/16), or be U-shaped (1/16). 
Generally, the most speciose subfamily is distributed more broadly (GET RANGE DATA) and persists in higher elevations than species in the other subfamilies. 
As with species richness patterns of the most speciose genus, the species richness patterns of the most speciose subfamilies tend to be remarkably similar to both the overall species richness pattern and the richness pattern of the remaining species. 
The elevational species richness pattern does not result from the richness pattern of the most speciose subfamily. 
  
### Wrap up and transition  
- Species richness patterns are not driven by a single genus or subfamily  
- Rather, taxonomic subsets tend to show qualitatively similar patterns  
- Much variation among transects in details, but most often, the most speciose taxon dominates at high elevations  
- So ant richness pattern isn't contingent on taxonomy... underlying drivers may be the same for all subtaxa...   
  
# Taxonomic richness patterns  
### Species richness  
In the robust datasets, ant species richness most often peaks at intermediate elevations (14/20), though decreasing (3/20) and low plateau (3/20) patterns also occur (Fig. 1). 
Regional and local scale datasets showed nearly identical species richness pattern distributions. 
In the excluded datasets, the patterns were more variable. 
In addition to the mid-peaks, decreases, and low plateaus seen in the robust datasets, there were also gradients with increasing richness and no identifiable richness pattern. 
Furthermore, decreasing patterns were nearly as common as mid-peaks in the excluded datasets. 
Some of these decreasing patterns, however, are likely an artefact of sampling bias. 
The majority did not sample within the lowest 400m, potentially failing to capture the portion of the gradient across which the common patterns differ the most. 
Ant species richness, therefore, shows a variety of elevational patterns, with richness often highest at intermediate elevations. 
  
### Genus richness  
In the 16 robust datasets with species-level elevational ranges, the number of genera across elevations typically mirrors the number of species, and the number of species increases quite predictably with the number of genera (stats: lme?). 
Genus richness peaks at or below the elevation with the highest species richness. 
 
  
### Subfamily richness  
The number of ant subfamilies shows less distinct patterns elevationally than the number of species or the number of genera, though they are generally coarsely similar to the species and genus richness patterns. 
The richness patterns within the non-dominant subfamilies are less clear due to the lower total number of species. 
However, the subfamilies with enough species tend to follow the same overall trend as the total species richness pattern. 
  
### Wrap up and transition

# Into the unknown: what data do we need?  
Many hypotheses have been proposed as drivers of ant community structure, richness, and diversity along elevational gradients. 
However, the consistent and reliable data needed to rigorously evaluate these hypotheses are lacking at a broad scale. 
Habitat complexity, and in particular vegetation structure and leaf litter depth, has been suggested as a potential driver of ant diversity [@LassHoch2004; @Sarty2006; @PachVasc2011; @Bharti2013]. 
Such data have not been widely collected across elevational gradients with ant species data. 
Additionally, we know little of the basic biology for many species of ants. 
Dietary, foraging, and nesting habits can vary dramatically within a genus or even within a species **CITE**. 
Understanding how biotic interactions, such as competition for space or food resources, and changes in their strength across elevations affect ant communities relies on thoroughly detailing behavior across a wide taxonomic variety of ant species. 
Finally, ant communities can vary substantially across seasons and years [@Bishop2014], variation that has rarely been accounted for. 
A greater focus on seasonal and annual fluctuations will inform mechanistic approaches to understanding patterns of ant communities.

# Conclusion  
  
  
# Figure Legends  
**Figure 1.** Elevational range sizes of ant species increases with latitude. 
(a) Both the mean (solid; ± 1 standard error) and median (open) elevational range increases with distance from the equator (STATS). 
(b) This trend does not appear to be driven by the height of the mountain. 
The mean elevational range size increases with latitude with all three truncation heights (STATS).  

**Figure 2.** Gradient-wide beta diversity decreases with latitude and turnover decreases with taxonomic resolution. 
(a) Total beta diversity across each elevational gradient, standardized for the number of sampled elevations, declines with latitude (STATS). 
That is, the differences in ant communities across elevations is more extreme in the tropics. 
(b) In both temperate (white) and tropic (gray) gradients, the proportion of beta diversity due to turnover decreases at higher taxonomic levels. 
The ant communities differ primarily due to the sequential addition or loss of taxa across elevations rather than due to the replacement of one taxon with another.  

**Figure 3.** Richness of the most speciose genus or subfamily predicts the richness of the remaining species. 
(a) The elevational richness pattern of the most speciose genus is nested within the richness pattern of the remaining species for most gradients. 
The trend is apparent with all datasets combined (black line) and within each gradients (gray lines). 
There is much variability in the slope of the relationship across gradients and, in one case, a negative relationship. 
(b) The apparent nestedness of the richness patterns becomes stronger at the subfamily level. 
The relationship is strong with all datasets combined (black line) and much less variable among transects (gray lines) compared to the genus level.  

**Figure 4.** Robust patterns of ant species richness across elevational gradients. 
A variety of patterns have been observed, though mid-elevational peaks are most common. 
The pattern distribution is similar for both species (black) and genus (gray) richness. 
The subfamily richness patterns are less discernible due to the small number of subfamilies along many gradients.
