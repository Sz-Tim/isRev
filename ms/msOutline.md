Tropical species should have smaller ranges because of seasonal consistency

# Introduction  
elevational gradients; value of insects; ant taxonomic ecology; mtn passes/rapoport's; beta diversity/turnover  


### Elevational gradients, ranges, and community compositon  
The distribution and delineation of species ranges by definition influences patterns of species richness.  
Species richness is the overlap of species ranges  
Compositional change is driven by the dynamics of range boundaries  
Elevational gradients are valuable study systems  
Mountains act as replicated systems  
Bring in ants somehow... 
Detailing how communities change across elevational gradients and at different taxonomic levels can yield insight into the dynamic processes that shape biodiversity at a broad scale.  
### Value of insects  
Keep more or less as is I think  
### Ant taxonomic ecology  
Lots of variation among subfamilies  
Body size, nesting habits, diet, colony size, etc (specific examples)  
Are the spp ranges across subfamilies controlled by the same factors?  
Does it make sense to think of ant richness as a whole?  
Are ants, as a taxon, cohesive in this regard?  
Huge variation in number of species among subfamilies  
Is the overall pattern swamped by one taxon?  
**Braid this in with spp/genus/sf similarities and differences**  
### Challenge  
Understanding distribution of biodiversity necessitates...  
Here, I review the work to date on ant communities across elevations  
with specific regard to:  
. elevational range sizes  
. community composition  
. and species richness  
Using well-sampled elevational datasets, 
I investigate these patterns at the species, genus, and subfamily level  
Final good wrap up sentence?  
  
# II. State of the data  
### i. Literature search  
### ii. Criteria  
### iii. Study descriptions  
### iv. Pattern definitions  
  
# III. Range size  
Figure 1: Mean & median range size and latitude  
### i. Brief methods  
Expect that elevational ranges are broader in the tropics  
Mountain passes are higher because of narrower thermal range  
Comparisons among gradients may be sensitive to gradient height  
Truncation method: only use gradients > height and truncate mtns to height  
Three heights: 1600 (13), 1800 (12), 2000 (10)  
All gradients (16)
### ii. Among gradients  
There is a strong latitudinal signal  
Seen in the mean and median range sizes  
Seen in all three truncations  
More species in tropics detected at just one elevation  
No trend in the mean elevational range of genera or subfamilies with any method  
### iii. Along gradients  
Elevational extension of Rapaport's rule is the expectation  
However, no consistent trend  
The Steven's method, which uses all spp at a given elevation, had strongest fit  
But biased  
The midpoint method, which uses only spp whose midpt is at that el, had no fit  
The quartile method, which uses only spp whose range is < 1/4 mtn, had no fit  
Ant species do not support elevational Rapaport's rule  
### iv. Wrap up and transition  
Thus, though no consistent pattern along a single gradient,
elevational ranges of ant species are larger at temperate latitudes  
Suggests that thermal tolerances of tropical species may be narrower  
Alternatively, could be strong competition btw ant spp across elevations  
Regardless, should lead to more intense changes in community comp across els

##### Whole gradient calculations, controlling for gradient size  
##### Nestedness vs turnover  
### ii. Species

### iii. Genera  
##### Among gradients: Latitude  
##### Along gradients: Generally highest at edges, esp. high elevations  
##### Tâ‰ˆN for whole gradient, but higher N between adjacent elevations  
### iv. Subfamilies  
##### Among gradients: Latitude  
##### Along gradients: Generally highest at edges, esp. high elevations  
##### Higher N for whole gradient, no T between adjacent elevations

### i. Most speciose genus  
7-31%  
no significant latitudinal pattern  
S.rest ~ S.dom -- variable b/r, but good on average  
S.peak ~ S.dompeak  
richness pattern of dominant is nested within total pattern  
### ii. Most speciose subfamily  
39-73%  
tropics?
S.rest ~ S.dom -- much higher concordance than at genus level  
S.peak?  
overall pattern not driven by one subfamily  
rest of species are distributed similarly

# VII. Into the future  

# VIII. Conclusion  
Recap of results:  
Ant elevational ranges are narrowest at tropical latitudes, leading to higher gradient-wide beta diversity and high species turnover. 
This trend becomes increasingly less distinct at higher taxonomic levels and community compositions are nested. 
The elevational richness patterns, driven by ant species as a whole rather than by a single genus or subfamily, do not appear to be directly related to turnover. 
The broad similarity of richness patterns along a given gradient, including species richness, genus richness, or richness within genera or subfamilies, suggests that, despite large biological differences, similar factors may influence the elevational distribution of ant species across many genera and subfamilies.
