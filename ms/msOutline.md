# III. Taxonomic patterns  
## i. Species  
### Well-sampled vs poorly sampled  
  
## ii. Genera  
### Diversity of genera  
### Diversity within genera  
### Diversity of most-speciose genus vs rest 

## iii. Subfamilies  
### Diversity of subfamilies  
### Diversity within subfamilies  
### Diversity of most-speciose subfamily vs rest  
  

# IV. Beta diversity    
Split by components or by taxonomy?  
How does this square with small range sizes? How is nestedness so high?  
## i. Species  
### Total beta diversity  
U, I, flat. 
Mostly U-shaped though. 
Opposite of ecotone expectations - generally low at middle elevations.  
### Turnover vs Nestedness  
Nestedness is often U-shaped, highest at the base and peak. 
Nestedness is highest at high elevations - environmental filtering? 
Turnover is more variable: D, LP, HP, MP, I, U.  
### Differences among mountain types/climates?  
  
## ii. Genus  
worth it to look within genera?  
### Total beta diversity  
U, I, flat (but flat maybe a U). 
Mostly U or truncated U with a dip at middle elevations.   
### Turnover vs Nestedness  
Nestedness is often U-shaped, highest at the base and peak. 
Nestedness makes up a larger component at most elevations along most transects. 
Turnover is generally low, but somewhat variable.  
### Differences among mountain types/climates?  

## i. Subfamily  
### Total beta diversity  
### Turnover vs Nestedness  
### Differences among mountain types/climates?  
  
## iv. Comparison across taxonomic levels (spp vs gen)   
### All are generally higher at the spp than gen level  
Beta decreases as taxonomic resolution decreases. 
Turnover drops heavily, esp at sf level.  
### Several sites where turnover is much higher  
### Anything consistent?  
  
 
# V. Nesting habits  
  

# VI. Specialization  
    

# VIII. Commonly suggested, seldom evaluated  
## Habitat complexity  
## Litter depth  
## Changes through time  
- Bishop et al 2014  
- Dunn/Sanders/someone paper about queen release  

# IX. Conclusion  
Patterns of ant richness are complex and varied. 
Good foundation, much to uncover.   
  
  
  
  
  one ring to rule them all?
  all sf's or all genera seem to behave similarly...
