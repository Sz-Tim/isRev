# III. Range size  
Figure 1: Mean & median range size and latitude  
### i. Brief methods  
Expect that elevational ranges are broader in the tropics  
Mountain passes are higher because of narrower thermal range  
Comparisons among gradients may be sensitive to gradient height  
Truncation method: only use gradients > height and truncate mtns to height  
Three heights: 1600 (13), 1800 (12), 2000 (10)  
All gradients (16)
### ii. Among gradients  
There is a strong latitudinal signal  
Seen in the mean and median range sizes  
Seen in all three truncations  
More species in tropics detected at just one elevation  
No trend in the mean elevational range of genera or subfamilies with any method  
### iii. Along gradients  
Elevational extension of Rapaport's rule is the expectation  
However, no consistent trend  
The Steven's method, which uses all spp at a given elevation, had strongest fit  
But biased  
The midpoint method, which uses only spp whose midpt is at that el, had no fit  
The quartile method, which uses only spp whose range is < 1/4 mtn, had no fit  
Ant species do not support elevational Rapaport's rule  
### iv. Wrap up and transition  
Thus, though no consistent pattern along a single gradient,
elevational ranges of ant species are larger at temperate latitudes  
Suggests that thermal tolerances of tropical species may be narrower  
Alternatively, could be strong competition btw ant spp across elevations  
Regardless, should lead to more intense changes in community comp across els  
  
# IV. Composition & beta diversity

### i. Beta background and methods  
##### Definition, variation in composition  
##### Whole gradient calculations, controlling for gradient size  
##### Nestedness vs turnover  
### ii. Species  
##### Among gradients: Latitude  
##### Along gradients: Generally highest at edges  
##### Higher T for whole gradient, but N between adjacent elevations  
### iii. Genera  
##### Among gradients: Latitude  
##### Along gradients: Generally highest at edges, esp. high elevations  
##### Tâ‰ˆN for whole gradient, but higher N between adjacent elevations  
### iv. Subfamilies  
##### Among gradients: Latitude  
##### Along gradients: Generally highest at edges, esp. high elevations  
##### Higher N for whole gradient, no T between adjacent elevations

# IV. Beta diversity    
Split by components or by taxonomy?  
How does this square with small range sizes? How is nestedness so high?  
## i. Species  
### Total beta diversity  
U, I, flat. 
Mostly U-shaped though. 
Opposite of ecotone expectations - generally low at middle elevations.  
### Turnover vs Nestedness  
Nestedness is often U-shaped, highest at the base and peak. 
Nestedness is highest at high elevations - environmental filtering? 
Turnover is more variable: D, LP, HP, MP, I, U.  
### Differences among mountain types/climates?  
  
## ii. Genus  
worth it to look within genera?  
### Total beta diversity  
U, I, flat (but flat maybe a U). 
Mostly U or truncated U with a dip at middle elevations.   
### Turnover vs Nestedness  
Nestedness is often U-shaped, highest at the base and peak. 
Nestedness makes up a larger component at most elevations along most transects. 
Turnover is generally low, but somewhat variable.  
### Differences among mountain types/climates?  

## i. Subfamily  
### Total beta diversity  
### Turnover vs Nestedness  
### Differences among mountain types/climates?  
  
## iv. Comparison across taxonomic levels (spp vs gen)   
### All are generally higher at the spp than gen level  
Beta decreases as taxonomic resolution decreases. 
Turnover drops heavily, esp at sf level.  
### Several sites where turnover is much higher  
### Anything consistent?  
  
 
~~# V. Natural history~~  
~~## Nesting~~  
~~Ant nests may be either underground, for instance in the soil, in decaying wood, or under rocks, or arboreal such as nests on epiphytes, in tree trunks, or as carton nests. 
Nesting strategies vary among ant species and, in some cases, within species. 
For many ant species, such basic natural history is not known.~~ 
~~## Diet specialization~~  
~~## Take home~~  

# V. Range size  
## Mean across whole gradient  
Larger at regional scale than local scale.  
Larger in temperate than tropics. 
Both absolute and as a proportion of the gradient for temp vs tropic, but complicated with scale... 
Latitude: increases absolutely, but  
## Changes along the gradient  
    

# VIII. Commonly suggested, seldom evaluated  
Habitat complexity, litter depth, biotic interactions, diet, any and all natural history, changes through time
- Bishop et al 2014  
- Dunn/Sanders/someone paper about queen release  
- Particular parts of the world that need focus  
- Local vs regional?  

# IX. Conclusion  
Patterns of ant richness are complex and varied. 
Good foundation, much to uncover.   
  
  
  
  
  one ring to rule them all?
  all sf's or all genera seem to behave similarly...
