Submitted by the end of May, published at the end of the year  
  
Need to check with Mike Breed about:  
- Length and scope  
	- How broad?  
	- Recent reviews look like more summary than new analysis - das stimmt?  
	- How many pages?  
	- How many figures?  
	- Better to focus on one main aspect below? Or sample from several broad categories?   
	- Should I discuss diversity hypotheses?  

### Possible directions:
##### Taxonomy  
- Does each subfamily show the same pattern along a given gradient?  
- Do subfamilies show consistent patterns across gradients?  
- How does the number of genera change?  
- How does average elevational range size vary among subfamilies?      
##### Natural history   
- For tropical gradients, what are the patterns of arboreal vs ground ants?  
- Does average colony size change with elevation?  
- Does worker body size change with elevation? (size classes?)  
- Does feeding strategy change along elevational gradients?  
	- Predatory vs seed harvesting vs omnivores etc  
		- Stable isotope studies (Moony, Tillberg)  
	- At the genus level even?  
- Split species into small, medium, large range sizes; look at div patterns  
- Reproductive flights (Dunn et al 2007, Kaspari et al 2001 & 2001)  
- Reproductive strategies  
  
   
### Focus on:
- Does each subfamily show the same pattern along a given gradient?  
- Do subfamilies show consistent patterns across gradients?  
- How does the number of genera change?  
- How does average elevational range size vary among subfamilies?  
- Split species into small, medium, large range sizes; look at diversity patterns  
- For tropical gradients, what are the patterns of arboreal vs ground ants?  
- Does feeding strategy (maybe generalized at the genus level) change along elevational gradients?  
  

Rapaport's rule and range sizes in tropics vs temperate -- taxonomic patterns  
Christy's mtn pass paper for removing influence of mtn gradient sizes  
beta across entire gradient: tropics vs temperate  
too much to do beta + turnover + nestedness  
carabid elevational ranges (ecology)

# Notes from writing meeting 2015.04.16  
Basic structure of intro is alright  
. how to tie different parts together?  
. what's interesting?  
. play up biological differences between subfamilies?  
. definitely a paragraph about subfamily differences (previous work)  
	. include some natural history information here  
	. these are variable, these aren't - treat as binomial even?  
	. coarse way to look at evolutionary trajectories  
. turnover within a genus/subfamily?  
. LIDAR data could be useful? Spatial scale and resolution?
. Mtn passes higher?  
	  . Rap's rule  
	  . turnover should be higher with smaller range size?  
	  . taxonomic patterns  
. Most diverse genus/sf predicting the rest - more robust way to do it  
. Scale multisite metrics for number of sites
