@book{CokeFran1990,
abstract = {In Part I of this series, Moody and Francke (1982) reported that the subfamily Myrmicinae is represented in western Texas by 17 genera and 89 species. Herein, 24 genera and 83 species are recorded from western Texas in the subfamilies Ecitoninae, Ponerinae, Pseudomyrmecinae, Dolichoderinae, and Formicinae. Two additional species (Formica neoclara and Hypoponera punctatissima) are probably also present, based on their known distributions elsewhere in Texas and surrounding states. Although several species are wide ranging, most are restricted to one or two vegetative regions. Thirteen wide ranging species are present in all of the western Texas regions: Brachymyrmex depilis, Camponotus discolor, C. festinatus, Conomyrma bicolor, C. flava, C. insana, Forelius foetidus, F. pruinosus, Formica gnava, Labidus coecus, Myrmecocystus placodops, Odontomachus clarus, and Paratrechina vividula. Eight other species are relatively common and were found in four of the five regions sampled: Camponotus sansabeanus, C. vicinus, Hypoponera opacior, Myrmecocystus depilis, M. mendax, M. mimicus, Neivamyrmex nigrescens, and Paratrechina terricola. More species were encountered in the Trans-Pecos region than in any other region in western Texas. Furthermore, more species are restricted to the Trans-Pecos area than all others taken together from the other regions in western Texas. Of the 58 species recorded from the Trans-Pecos, 21 were restricted to that region: Acanthomyops arizonicus, Amblyopone pallipes, Camponotus abdominalis transvectus, C. cuauhtemoc, C. ocreatus, C. ulcerosus, Cerapachys davisi, Colobopsis pylartes, Formica nitidiventris, F. puberula, Hypoponera opaciceps, Lasius sitiens, Liometopum luctuosum, Myrmecocystus melliger, Neivamyrmex fallax, N. macropterus, N. minor, N. pauxillus, Paratrechina austroccidua, P. bruesii, and P. pallidus. The wide variety of habitats- from lowland deserts to highland coniferous forests certainly- accounts for much of this diversity in ants. Approximately the same numbers of ant species occur in the High Plains, Rolling Plains, and portion of the Edwards Plateau in western Texas; 34, 38, and 47, respectively. Those species restricted to the High Plains of western Texas include: Formica bradleyi, F. gynocrates, F. montana, F. sp. (near integroides), and Myrmecocystus romainei. Species recorded only from the Rolling Plains are: Acanthomyops interjectus, Formica pallidefulva, F. subsericea, and Myrmecocystus navajo. The two species recorded only from the Edwards Plateau are Neivamyrmex melsheimeri and Proceratium compitale. Only 23 species are recorded from that portion of the Rio Grande Plains which extends into western Texas. Of those species, only three, Neivamyrmex fuscipennis, N. texanus, and Pachycondyla villosa do not occur elsewhere in western Texas.},

abstract = {This study investigated factors responsible for the decline of ant species richness with increasing elevation in an evergreen tropical rain forest on Mount Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia. From 580 m to 1520 m a.s.l., we studied the ant community as well as biotic \& abiotic factors in parallel on the ground \& in the lower vegetation. We collected a total of 376 ant morphospecies, belonging to 65 genera and 8 subfamilies. The decline of ant species richness was significantly correlated with the decline in temperature, but the pattern of decline differed between the two strata. In contrast, the ant nest density remained the same on the ground \& in the lower vegetation up to 1000 m, but then dropped significantly. As the main nesting resource, dead wood, remained rather constant over the elevation gradient, the most plausible explanation is a direct impact of temperature. In addition, the increasing compaction of the soil \& increased depth of the humus layer, also restricts nesting on the ground at the highest elevations. A case study of the ground ant Diacamma sp. along the elevation gradient indicated scarcity of food, as another important factor in the ground layer uphill.},

@article{NB2008,
abstract = {Despite two centuries of effort in characterizing environmental gradients of species richness in search of universal patterns, surprisingly few of these patterns have been widely acknowledged. Species richness along altitudinal gradients was previously assumed to increase universally from cool highlands to warm lowlands, mirroring the latitudinal increase in species richness from cool to warm latitudes. However, since the more recent general acceptance of altitudinal gradients as model templates for testing hypotheses behind large-scale patterns of diversity, these gradients have been used in support of all the main diversity hypotheses, although little consensus has been achieved. Here we show that when resampling a data set comprising 400,000 records for 3,046 Pyrenean floristic species at different scales of analysis (achieved by varying grain size and the extent of the gradients sampled), the derived species richness pattern changed progressively from hump-shaped to a monotonic pattern as the scale of extent diminished. Scale effects alone gave rise to as many conflicting patterns of species richness as had previously been reported in the literature, and scale effects lent significantly different statistical support to competing diversity hypotheses. Effects of scale on current studies may be affected by human activities, because montane ecosystems and human activities are intimately connected. This interdependence has led to a global reduction in natural lowland habitats, hampering our ability to detect universal patterns and impeding the search for universal diversity gradients to discover the mechanisms determining the distribution of biological diversity on Earth.},

abstract = {A recent increase in studies of $\beta$ diversity has yielded a confusing array of concepts, measures and methods. Here, we provide a roadmap of the most widely used and ecologically relevant approaches for analysis through a series of mission statements. We distinguish two types of $\beta$ diversity: directional turnover along a gradient vs. non-directional variation. Different measures emphasize different properties of ecological data. Such properties include the degree of emphasis on presence/absence vs. relative abundance information and the inclusion vs. exclusion of joint absences. Judicious use of multiple measures in concert can uncover the underlying nature of patterns in $\beta$ diversity for a given dataset. A case study of Indonesian coral assemblages shows the utility of a multi-faceted approach. We advocate careful consideration of relevant questions, matched by appropriate analyses. The rigorous application of null models will also help to reveal potential processes driving observed patterns in $\beta$ diversity.},

abstract = {Studies of species diversity patterns across regional environmental gradients seldom consider the impact of habitat type on within-site (alpha) and between-site (beta) diversity. This study is designed to identify the influence of habitat type across geographic and environmental space, on local patterns of species richness and regional turnover patterns of ant diversity in the northeastern United States. Specifically, I aim to 1) compare local species richness in paired open and forested transects and identify the environmental variables that best correlate with richness; and 2) document patterns of beta diversity throughout the region in both open and forested habitat. I systematically sampled ants at 67 sites from May to August 2010, spanning 10 degrees of latitude, and 1000 meters of elevation. Patterns of alpha and beta diversity across the region and along environmental gradients differed between forested and open habitats. Local species richness was higher in the low elevation and warmest sites and was always higher in open habitat than in forest habitat transects. Richness decreased as temperature decreased or elevation increased. Forested transects show strong patterns of decreasing dissimilarity in species composition between sites along the temperature gradient but open habitat transects did not. Maximum temperature of the warmest month better predicted species richness than either latitude or elevation. I find that using environmental variables as key predictors of richness yields more biologically relevant results, and produces simpler macroecological models than commonly used models which use only latitude and elevation as predictors of richness and diversity patterns. This study contributes to the understanding of mechanisms that structure the communities of important terrestrial arthropods which are likely to be influenced by climatic change.},

@article{Svenning2011,
abstract = {1. Environmental sorting, historical factors and neutral dynamics may all drive beta diversity (change in species composition across space), but their relative importance remains unresolved. In the case of European mammals, key potential drivers of large-scale beta diversity include current climate, neutral dynamics and two historical factors: Pleistocene glaciations and peninsular dynamics (immigration from extra-regional eastern faunal source areas and inter-linked relictual survival and evolutionary differentiation in isolated areas). 2. We assessed the relative importance of these drivers using a novel analytical framework to deconstruct beta diversity of non-volant mammals in Europe (138 species) into its turnover (change in species composition because of species replacements) and nestedness components (change in species composition because of species richness differences) at continental and regional (250,000 km(2) ) scales. 3. We found continental-scale mammal beta diversity to be mainly caused by spatial turnover (99·9\%), with only a small contribution (0·1\%) from nestedness. 4. Current climate emerged as an important driver of beta diversity, given the strong continental-scale turnover, particularly in north-south direction, i.e., in line with the latitudinal climate gradient, and, more directly, the strong correlation of climate with spatial turnover at both continental and regional scales. 5. However, there was also evidence for the importance of non-climatic drivers. Notably, the compositional variation purely accounted for by space was greater than that purely accounted for by environment for both the turnover and the nestedness component of beta diversity. Furthermore, the strong longitudinal turnover within Southern Europe is in accordance with the region's long-term climatic stability having allowed multiple refugia and local evolutionary diversification. As expected from peninsular dynamics, there was increasing dissimilarity with geographic distance in an east-west direction because of nestedness, but only in Central and Northern Europe. 6. In conclusion, European mammal beta diversity mainly reflects spatial turnover and only to a limited extent nestedness and is driven by current climate in combination with historical - and perhaps, neutral - dynamics. These findings suggest that a key challenge for climate-change predictive studies will be taking the influence of non-climatic factors into account.},
