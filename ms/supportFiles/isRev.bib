abstract = {* Beta diversity is a conceptual link between diversity at local and regional scales. Various additional methodologies of quantifying this and related phenomena have been applied. Among them, measures of pairwise (dis)similarity of sites are particularly popular. Undersampling, i.e. not recording all taxa present at a site, is a common situation in ecological data. Bias in many metrics related to beta diversity must be expected, but only few studies have explicitly investigated the properties of various measures under undersampling conditions. * On the basis of an empirical data set, representing near-complete local inventories of the Lepidoptera from an isolated Pacific island, as well as simulated communities with varying properties, we mimicked different levels of undersampling. We used 14 different approaches to quantify beta diversity, among them dataset-wide multiplicative partitioning (i.e. ‘true beta diversity’) and pairwise site x site dissimilarities. We compared their values from incomplete samples to true results from the full data. We used these comparisons to quantify undersampling bias and we calculated correlations of the dissimilarity measures of undersampled data with complete data of sites. * Almost all tested metrics showed bias and low correlations under moderate to severe undersampling conditions (as well as deteriorating precision, i.e. large chance effects on results). Measures that used only species incidence were very sensitive to undersampling, while abundance-based metrics with high dependency on the distribution of the most common taxa were particularly robust. Simulated data showed sensitivity of results to the abundance distribution, confirming that data sets of high evenness and/or the application of metrics that are strongly affected by rare species are particularly sensitive to undersampling. * The class of beta measure to be used should depend on the research question being asked as different metrics can lead to quite different conclusions even without undersampling effects. For each class of metric, there is a trade-off between robustness to undersampling and sensitivity to rare species. In consequence, using incidence-based metrics carries a particular risk of false conclusions when undersampled data are involved. Developing bias corrections for such metrics would be desirable.},

@article{Ghalambor2006,
abstract = {Synopsis In 1967 Daniel Janzen published an influential paper titled "Why Mountain Passes Are Higher in the Tropics." Janzen derived a simple climatic-physiological model predicting that tropical mountain passes would be more effective barriers to organismal dispersal than would temperate-zone passes of equivalent altitude. This prediction derived from a recognition that the annual variation in ambient temperature at any site is relatively low in the tropics. Such low variation within sites not only reduces the seasonal overlap in thermal regimes between low- and high-altitude sites, but should also select for organisms with narrow physiological tolerances to temperature. As a result, Janzen predicted that tropical lowland organisms are more likely to encounter a mountain pass as a physiological barrier to dispersal (hence "higher"), which should in turn favor smaller distributions and an increase in species turnover along altitudinal gradients. This synthetic hypothesis has long been at the center of discussions of latitudinal patterns of physiological adaptation and of species diversity. Here we review some of the key assumptions and predictions of Janzen's hypothesis. We find general support for many assumptions and predictions, but call attention to several issues that somewhat ameliorate the generality of Janzen's classic hypothesis.},

abstract = {Numerous ecological and evolutionary processes are thought to play a role in maintaining the high plant species diversity of tropical forests. An understanding of the phylogenetic structure of an ecological community can provide insights into the relative importance of different processes structuring that community. The objectives of this study were to measure the phylogenetic structure of Neotropical forest tree communities in the Forest Dynamics Plot (FDP) on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, to determine how the phylogenetic structure of tree communities varied among spatial scales and habitats within the FDP, and to study the effects of null-model choice on estimates of community phylogenetic structure. We measured community phylogenetic structure for tree species occurring together in quadrats ranging in size from 10 x 10 m to 100 X 100 m in the FDP. We estimated phylogenetic structure by comparing observed phylogenetic distances among species to the distribution of phylogenetic distances for null communities generated using two different null models. A null model that did not maintain observed species occurrence frequencies tended to find nonrandom community phylogenetic structure, even for random data. Using a null model that maintained observed species frequencies in null communities, the average phylogenetic structure of tree communities in the FDP was close to random at all spatial scales examined, but more quadrats than expected contained species that were phylogenetically clustered or overdispersed, and phylogenetic structure varied among habitats. In young forests and plateau habitats, communities were phylogenetically clustered, meaning that trees were more closely related to their neighbors than expected, while communities in swamp and slope habitats were phylogenetically overdispersed, meaning that trees were more distantly related to their neighbors than expected. Phylogenetic clustering suggests the importance of environmental filtering of phylogenetically conserved traits in young forests and plateau habitats, but the phylogenetic overdispersion observed in other habitats has several possible explanations, including variation in the strength of ecological processes among habitats or the phylogenetic history of niches, traits, and habitat associations. Future studies will need to include information on species traits in order to explain the variation in phylogenetic structure among habitats in tropical forests.},

@article{ShelTewk2014,
abstract = {Environmental temperature variation can influence physiology, biogeography, and life history, with large consequences for ecology, evolution, and the impacts of climate change. Based on the seasonality hypothesis, greater annual temperature variation at high latitudes should result in greater thermal tolerance and, consequently, larger elevational ranges in temperate compared to tropical species. Despite the mechanistic nature of this hypothesis, most research has used latitude as a proxy for seasonality, failing to directly examine the impact of temperature variation on physiology and range size. We used phylogenetically matched beetles from locations spanning 608 of latitude to explore links between seasonality, physiology and elevational range. Thermal tolerance increased with seasonality across all beetle groups, but realized seasonality (temperature variation restricted to the months species are active) was a better predictor of thermal tolerance than was annual seasonality. Additionally, beetles with greater thermal tolerance had larger elevational ranges. Our results support a mechanistic framework linking variation in realized temperature to physiology and distributions.},

@article{Tuomisto2010,
abstract = {The prevailing terminological confusion around the concept 'diversity' has hampered accurate communication and caused diversity issues to appear unnecessarily complicated. In fact, a consistent terminology for phenomena related to (species) diversity is already available. When this terminology is adhered to, diversity emerges as an easily understood concept. It is important to differentiate between diversity itself and a diversity index: an index of something is just a surrogate for the thing itself. The conceptual problem of defining diversity also has to be separated from the practical problem of deciding how to adequately quantify diversity for a community of interest. In practice, diversity can be quantified for any dataset where units of observation (such as individuals) have been classified into types (such as species). All that needs to be known is what proportion of the observed units belong to a type of mean abundance. Diversity equals the inverse of this mean, and it quantifies the effective number of the types of interest. In ecology, interest often (but not always) focuses on species diversity. If the dataset consists of (or gets divided into) subunits, then the total effective number of species (gamma diversity) can be partitioned into the effective number of compositionally distinct subunits (beta diversity) and the mean effective number of species per such subunit (alpha diversity). Species richness is related to species diversity, but they are not the same thing; richness does not take the proportional abundances into account and is therefore the actual-rather than the effective-number of types. Most of the phenomena that have been called 'beta diversity' in the past do not quantify an effective number of types, so they should be referred to by names other than 'diversity' (for example, species turnover or differentiation).},

abstract = {Using published distributions of 65 species from the British Isles and northern Europe, we show that ant assemblages change with latitude in two ways. First, as commonly found for many types of organisms, the number of ant species decreased significantly with increasing latitude. For Ireland and Great Britain, species richness also increased significantly with region area. Second, although rarely demonstrated for ectotherms, the body size of ant species, as measured by worker length, increased significantly with increasing latitude. We found that this body-size pattern existed in the subfamily Formicinae and, to a lesser extent, in the Myrmicinae, which together comprised 95\% of the ant species in our study area. There was a trend for formicines to increase in size with latitude faster than myrmicines. We also show that the pattern of increasing body size was due primarily to the ranges of ant species shifting to higher latitudes as their body sizes increased, with larger formicines becoming less represented at southerly latitudes and larger myrmicines becoming more represented at northerly latitudes. We conclude by discussing five potential mechanisms for generating the observed body-size patterns: the heat-conservation hypothesis, two hypotheses concerning phylogenetic history, the migration-ability hypothesis, and the starvation-resistance hypothesis.},

abstract = {Two methods are used to analyze latitudinal ranges of fish species: means of ranges of all species with a midpoint in the same 50 latitujde band plotted against latitude, and means of ranges of all species occurring in the same 50 latitude band plotted against latitude. Application of the first method to data on 894 teleost species from the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic oceans showed that species with midpoints of latitudinal ranges near the equator have, on the average, much greater latitudinal ranges than species with midpoints at higher latitudes. Ranges of species were more or less the same when the second method was used, because of larger ranges and greater species numbers of low-latitude species. Rapoport's rule, according to which high- latitude species have greater latitudinal range than low-latitude species, therefore does not generally apply to marine teleosts. In contrast, the rule applies to North American (720 species) and North European (61 species) freshwater fish above a latitude of approximately 40?N as demonstrated by both methods. The rule has not been shown to apply to any group of organisms below a latitude of approximately 25?-35?N. Attempts to explain greater species numbers of tropical species by narrower environmental tolerances of tropical species, as indicated by Rapo- port's rule, are therefore premature, and such an explanation does not hold for marine teleosts.},

@article{Svenning2011,
abstract = {1. Environmental sorting, historical factors and neutral dynamics may all drive beta diversity (change in species composition across space), but their relative importance remains unresolved. In the case of European mammals, key potential drivers of large-scale beta diversity include current climate, neutral dynamics and two historical factors: Pleistocene glaciations and peninsular dynamics (immigration from extra-regional eastern faunal source areas and inter-linked relictual survival and evolutionary differentiation in isolated areas). 2. We assessed the relative importance of these drivers using a novel analytical framework to deconstruct beta diversity of non-volant mammals in Europe (138 species) into its turnover (change in species composition because of species replacements) and nestedness components (change in species composition because of species richness differences) at continental and regional (250,000 km(2) ) scales. 3. We found continental-scale mammal beta diversity to be mainly caused by spatial turnover (99·9\%), with only a small contribution (0·1\%) from nestedness. 4. Current climate emerged as an important driver of beta diversity, given the strong continental-scale turnover, particularly in north-south direction, i.e., in line with the latitudinal climate gradient, and, more directly, the strong correlation of climate with spatial turnover at both continental and regional scales. 5. However, there was also evidence for the importance of non-climatic drivers. Notably, the compositional variation purely accounted for by space was greater than that purely accounted for by environment for both the turnover and the nestedness component of beta diversity. Furthermore, the strong longitudinal turnover within Southern Europe is in accordance with the region's long-term climatic stability having allowed multiple refugia and local evolutionary diversification. As expected from peninsular dynamics, there was increasing dissimilarity with geographic distance in an east-west direction because of nestedness, but only in Central and Northern Europe. 6. In conclusion, European mammal beta diversity mainly reflects spatial turnover and only to a limited extent nestedness and is driven by current climate in combination with historical - and perhaps, neutral - dynamics. These findings suggest that a key challenge for climate-change predictive studies will be taking the influence of non-climatic factors into account.},

@article{NB2008,
abstract = {Despite two centuries of effort in characterizing environmental gradients of species richness in search of universal patterns, surprisingly few of these patterns have been widely acknowledged. Species richness along altitudinal gradients was previously assumed to increase universally from cool highlands to warm lowlands, mirroring the latitudinal increase in species richness from cool to warm latitudes. However, since the more recent general acceptance of altitudinal gradients as model templates for testing hypotheses behind large-scale patterns of diversity, these gradients have been used in support of all the main diversity hypotheses, although little consensus has been achieved. Here we show that when resampling a data set comprising 400,000 records for 3,046 Pyrenean floristic species at different scales of analysis (achieved by varying grain size and the extent of the gradients sampled), the derived species richness pattern changed progressively from hump-shaped to a monotonic pattern as the scale of extent diminished. Scale effects alone gave rise to as many conflicting patterns of species richness as had previously been reported in the literature, and scale effects lent significantly different statistical support to competing diversity hypotheses. Effects of scale on current studies may be affected by human activities, because montane ecosystems and human activities are intimately connected. This interdependence has led to a global reduction in natural lowland habitats, hampering our ability to detect universal patterns and impeding the search for universal diversity gradients to discover the mechanisms determining the distribution of biological diversity on Earth.},

abstract = {The christening of the decline in the geographic extent of species from high to low latitudes as Rapoport's rule was a bold step. Allowing for a variety of potentially significant complications to the interpretation of empirical studies, evidence that this is indeed a general pattern is, at the very least, equivocal. The present taxonomically and regionally biased set of studies lend support to the recent suggestion that the pattern is a local phenomenon being expressed primarily in the Palaearctic and Nearctic above latitudes of 40-50??N. Five hypotheses have been proposed to explain the generation of latitudinal declines in range size where they do occur, with the past heavy emphasis on a climatic variability mechanism being eroded. Evidence is accruing in support of more than one such mechanism. Whatever the generality of the 'rule', it has undoubtedly served to stimulate a consideration of the role of spatial variation in range sizes in several areas of research in ecology and evolution.},

abstract = {The efficient investment of resources is often the route to ecological success, and the adaptability of resource investment may play a critical role in promoting biodiversity. The ants of the "hyperdiverse" genus Pheidole produce two discrete sterile castes, soldiers and minor workers. Within Pheidole, there is tremendous interspecific variation in proportion of soldiers. The causes and correlates of caste ratio variation among species of Pheidole remain enigmatic. Here we test whether a body size threshold model accounts for interspecific variation in caste ratio in Pheidole, such that species with larger body sizes produce relatively fewer soldiers within their colonies. We evaluated the caste ratio of 26 species of Pheidole and found that the body size of workers accounts for interspecific variation in the production of soldiers as we predicted. Twelve species sampled from one forest in Costa Rica yielded the same relationship as found in previously published data from many localities. We conclude that production of soldiers in the most species-rich group of ants is regulated by a body size threshold mechanism, and that the great variation in body size and caste ratio in Pheidole plays a role in niche divergence in this rapidly evolving taxon.},

abstract = {Insect societies function at various organisational levels. Most research has focused on one or other organisational extreme. At one extreme, it is the adaptive behaviours at the individual level, the behaviour of workers, which is of interest. At the other extreme, colony-level adaptive behaviour and swarm intelligence is the focus. However, between these two extremes, numerous functional adaptive units, or "parts," exist. These intermediate-level parts include the behavioural properties of "groups" or "teams" in which the functionality only emerges at the group-level and not within the individuals themselves, and also the structural properties of "self-assemblages" in which individuals link themselves together to form an adaptive configuration, such as a living bridge. We review another type of intermediate-level part in insect societies: these are the physical structures that ants build away from the nest. The structures, that are larger than an individual worker but smaller than the colony (hence intermediate), include cleared traits, walled trenches, arcades, tunnels, outstations, shelters, protective pens, shelters over nectaries, food coverings on foraging trails, elevated corridors, and bridges. They are found in a diverse range of species, and are constructed using a variety of materials. We detail the structures built by ants focussing chiefly on the adaptive benefits these structures may confer to the colony.},

abstract = {This study investigated factors responsible for the decline of ant species richness with increasing elevation in an evergreen tropical rain forest on Mount Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia. From 580 m to 1520 m a.s.l., we studied the ant community as well as biotic \& abiotic factors in parallel on the ground \& in the lower vegetation. We collected a total of 376 ant morphospecies, belonging to 65 genera and 8 subfamilies. The decline of ant species richness was significantly correlated with the decline in temperature, but the pattern of decline differed between the two strata. In contrast, the ant nest density remained the same on the ground \& in the lower vegetation up to 1000 m, but then dropped significantly. As the main nesting resource, dead wood, remained rather constant over the elevation gradient, the most plausible explanation is a direct impact of temperature. In addition, the increasing compaction of the soil \& increased depth of the humus layer, also restricts nesting on the ground at the highest elevations. A case study of the ground ant Diacamma sp. along the elevation gradient indicated scarcity of food, as another important factor in the ground layer uphill.},

abstract = {A tenet of macroecology is that physiological processes of organisms are linked to large-scale geographical patterns in environmental conditions. Species at higher latitudes experience greater seasonal temperature variation and are consequently predicted to withstand greater temperature extremes. We tested for relationships between breadths of thermal tolerance in ectothermic animals and the latitude of specimen location using all available data, while accounting for habitat, hemisphere, methodological differences and taxonomic affinity. We found that thermal tolerance breadths generally increase with latitude, and do so at a greater rate in the Northern Hemisphere. In terrestrial ectotherms, upper thermal limits vary little while lower thermal limits decrease with latitude. By contrast, marine species display a coherent poleward decrease in both upper and lower thermal limits. Our findings provide comprehensive global support for hypotheses generated from studies at smaller taxonomic subsets and geographical scales. Our results further indicate differences between terrestrial and marine ectotherms in how thermal physiology varies with latitude that may relate to the degree of temperature variability experienced on land and in the ocean.},

abstract = {Studies of species diversity patterns across regional environmental gradients seldom consider the impact of habitat type on within-site (alpha) and between-site (beta) diversity. This study is designed to identify the influence of habitat type across geographic and environmental space, on local patterns of species richness and regional turnover patterns of ant diversity in the northeastern United States. Specifically, I aim to 1) compare local species richness in paired open and forested transects and identify the environmental variables that best correlate with richness; and 2) document patterns of beta diversity throughout the region in both open and forested habitat. I systematically sampled ants at 67 sites from May to August 2010, spanning 10 degrees of latitude, and 1000 meters of elevation. Patterns of alpha and beta diversity across the region and along environmental gradients differed between forested and open habitats. Local species richness was higher in the low elevation and warmest sites and was always higher in open habitat than in forest habitat transects. Richness decreased as temperature decreased or elevation increased. Forested transects show strong patterns of decreasing dissimilarity in species composition between sites along the temperature gradient but open habitat transects did not. Maximum temperature of the warmest month better predicted species richness than either latitude or elevation. I find that using environmental variables as key predictors of richness yields more biologically relevant results, and produces simpler macroecological models than commonly used models which use only latitude and elevation as predictors of richness and diversity patterns. This study contributes to the understanding of mechanisms that structure the communities of important terrestrial arthropods which are likely to be influenced by climatic change.},

@article{Sarty2006,
abstract = {The role of habitat complexity in the coexistence of ant species is poorly understood. Here, we examine the influence of habitat complexity on coexistence patterns in ant communities of the remote Pacific atoll of Tokelau. The invasive yellow crazy ant, Anoplolepis gracilipes (Smith), exists in high densities on Tokelau, but still coexists with up to seven other epigeic ant species. The size-grain hypothesis (SGH) proposes that as the size of terrestrial walking organisms decreases, the perceived complexity of the environment increases and predicts that: (1) leg length increases allometrically with body size in ants, and (2) coexistence between ant species is facilitated by differential habitat use according to body size. Analysis of morphological variables revealed variation inconsistent with the morphological prediction of the SGH, as leg length increased allometrically with head length only. We also experimentally tested the ability of epigeic ants in the field to discover and dominate food resources in treatments of differing rugosity. A. gracilipes was consistently the first to discover food baits in low rugosity treatments, while smaller ant species were consistently the first to discover food baits in high rugosity treatments. In addition, A. gracilipes dominated food baits in planar treatments, while smaller ant species dominated baits in rugose treatments. We found that the normally predictable outcomes of exploitative competition between A. gracilipes and other ant species were reversed in the high rugosity treatments. Our results support the hypothesis that differential habitat use according to body size provides a mechanism for coexistence with the yellow crazy ant in Tokelau. The SGH may provide a mechanism for coexistence in other ant communities but also in communities of other terrestrial, walking insects that inhabit a complex landscape.},

@book{CokeFran1990,
abstract = {In Part I of this series, Moody and Francke (1982) reported that the subfamily Myrmicinae is represented in western Texas by 17 genera and 89 species. Herein, 24 genera and 83 species are recorded from western Texas in the subfamilies Ecitoninae, Ponerinae, Pseudomyrmecinae, Dolichoderinae, and Formicinae. Two additional species (Formica neoclara and Hypoponera punctatissima) are probably also present, based on their known distributions elsewhere in Texas and surrounding states. Although several species are wide ranging, most are restricted to one or two vegetative regions. Thirteen wide ranging species are present in all of the western Texas regions: Brachymyrmex depilis, Camponotus discolor, C. festinatus, Conomyrma bicolor, C. flava, C. insana, Forelius foetidus, F. pruinosus, Formica gnava, Labidus coecus, Myrmecocystus placodops, Odontomachus clarus, and Paratrechina vividula. Eight other species are relatively common and were found in four of the five regions sampled: Camponotus sansabeanus, C. vicinus, Hypoponera opacior, Myrmecocystus depilis, M. mendax, M. mimicus, Neivamyrmex nigrescens, and Paratrechina terricola. More species were encountered in the Trans-Pecos region than in any other region in western Texas. Furthermore, more species are restricted to the Trans-Pecos area than all others taken together from the other regions in western Texas. Of the 58 species recorded from the Trans-Pecos, 21 were restricted to that region: Acanthomyops arizonicus, Amblyopone pallipes, Camponotus abdominalis transvectus, C. cuauhtemoc, C. ocreatus, C. ulcerosus, Cerapachys davisi, Colobopsis pylartes, Formica nitidiventris, F. puberula, Hypoponera opaciceps, Lasius sitiens, Liometopum luctuosum, Myrmecocystus melliger, Neivamyrmex fallax, N. macropterus, N. minor, N. pauxillus, Paratrechina austroccidua, P. bruesii, and P. pallidus. The wide variety of habitats- from lowland deserts to highland coniferous forests certainly- accounts for much of this diversity in ants. Approximately the same numbers of ant species occur in the High Plains, Rolling Plains, and portion of the Edwards Plateau in western Texas; 34, 38, and 47, respectively. Those species restricted to the High Plains of western Texas include: Formica bradleyi, F. gynocrates, F. montana, F. sp. (near integroides), and Myrmecocystus romainei. Species recorded only from the Rolling Plains are: Acanthomyops interjectus, Formica pallidefulva, F. subsericea, and Myrmecocystus navajo. The two species recorded only from the Edwards Plateau are Neivamyrmex melsheimeri and Proceratium compitale. Only 23 species are recorded from that portion of the Rio Grande Plains which extends into western Texas. Of those species, only three, Neivamyrmex fuscipennis, N. texanus, and Pachycondyla villosa do not occur elsewhere in western Texas.},

@article{McCaBrac2012,
abstract = {Aim Elevational Rapoport’s rule, proposed in 1992 by Stevens, predicts that species ranges on mountains become larger in elevational extent with increasing elevation.Here we test this prediction using 160 datasets of range size measured by maximum elevational extents for bats, birds, frogs, non-volant small mammals, reptiles, and salamanders from mountains around the globe. Location Mountains distributed globally and spanning 36.5° S to 48.2° N. Methods We compare three methods: (1) the Stevens method, which uses the average range size of all specieswithin each elevational band (100-m bands); (2) the midpoint method, which uses the average range size of species whose midpoints occur in each elevational band; and (3) a quartile method that examines the distribution of only the smallest ranges (less than one-quarter of the mountain height) to see if their frequency distribution is negatively related to elevation. Results Support for the elevational Rapoport’s rule was weak across all groups of montane vertebrates. For the Stevens method, the mean r2 value was 0.32, and strong support (positive relationship, r2 value > 0.50) was detected in 40\% of the studies, ranging from 20\% for salamanders to 57\% for frogs. For the midpoint method, the mean r2 value was 0.06, and none of the datasets showed strong support. For the quartile method, the mean r2 value was 0.26, and strong support (negative relationship, r2 value > 0.40) was detected in 38\% of the studies, ranging between 10.5\% in salamanders and 58\% in reptiles. Main conclusions Across vertebrates, and within the literature for plants and invertebrates, more empirical studies find a lack of trend than the predicted trend of increasing range sizewith increasing elevation. Thus, elevational Rapoport’s rule is not a consistently predictive pattern for understanding montane patterns in range size. Keywords},

@article{Wheeler1991,
abstract = {Among social Hymenoptera, the evolution of the worker caste has reached its apex in the ants, in which some taxa have evolved complex physical worker caste systems. Diverse worker caste systems can be generated through regulation of three aspects of larval growth: critical size, growth parameters, and reprogramming of these factors. Even the most complex caste systems could have evolved simply by the addition of revised programs to the end of an ancestral developmental pathway for workers. Worker castes in ants provide a system in which to study the evolution of reaction norms and developmental switches. In ants, the simplest developmental switch, revision of critical size alone, does not lead to discontinuous phenotypes. Only when changes in growth rules are tied to the decision to revise critical size are distinct phenotypes produced from the alternative developmental programs. The addition of ever more physical castes may be limited by both developmental and ecological factors.},

abstract = {A recent increase in studies of $\beta$ diversity has yielded a confusing array of concepts, measures and methods. Here, we provide a roadmap of the most widely used and ecologically relevant approaches for analysis through a series of mission statements. We distinguish two types of $\beta$ diversity: directional turnover along a gradient vs. non-directional variation. Different measures emphasize different properties of ecological data. Such properties include the degree of emphasis on presence/absence vs. relative abundance information and the inclusion vs. exclusion of joint absences. Judicious use of multiple measures in concert can uncover the underlying nature of patterns in $\beta$ diversity for a given dataset. A case study of Indonesian coral assemblages shows the utility of a multi-faceted approach. We advocate careful consideration of relevant questions, matched by appropriate analyses. The rigorous application of null models will also help to reveal potential processes driving observed patterns in $\beta$ diversity.},

@misc{Janzen1967,
abstract = {This paper is designed to draw attention to the relation between tropical climatic uniformity at a given site and the effectiveness of topographic bar- riers adjacent to the site in preventing movements of plants and animals. This is not an attempt to explain tropical species diversity (see Pianka, 1966, for a review of this subject), but rather to discuss a factor that should be considered in any discussion of the relation between topographic and climatic diversity, and population isolation. Simpson (1964) states that "Small population ranges and numerous barriers against the spread and sym- patry of related populations would therefore tend to increase density of species in a region as a whole. It will be suggested below that this is a factor in the increase of species densities in regions of high topographic relief. I do not, however, know of any evidence that it is more general or more effective in the tropics." I believe that the climatic regimes discussed below, and the reactions of organisms to them, indicate that topographic barriers may be more effective in the tropics. Mountain barriers and their temperature gradients in Central America, as contrasted to those in North America, are used as examples; but it is believed that the central idea equally applies to other tropical areas, types of barriers, and physical parameters. There are three thoughts central to the argument to be developed: (1) in respect to temperature, it is the temperature gradient across a mountain range which determines its effectiveness as a barrier, rather than the abso- lute height; (2) in Central America, terrestrial temperature regimes are gen- erally more uniform than North American ones, and differ in their patterns of overlap across geographic barriers; and (3) it can be assumed that animals and plants are evolutionarily adapted to, and/or have the ability to acclimate to, the temperatures normally encountered in their temporal and geographic habitat (or microhabitat).

@article{Chao2012,
abstract = {There have been intense debates about the decomposition of regional diversity (gamma) into its within-community component (alpha) and between-community component (beta). Although a recent Ecology Forum achieved consensus in the use of "numbers equivalents" (Hill numbers) as the proper choice of diversity measure, three related major issues were still left unresolved. (1) What is the precise meaning of the "independence" or "statistical independence" of alpha diversity and beta diversity? (2) Which partitioning (additive vs. multiplicative) should be used for a given application? (3) What is the proper formula for alpha diversity, as there are two formulas in the literature? This paper proposes a possible resolution to each of these issues. For the first issue, we clarify the definitions of "independence" and "statistical independence" from two perspectives so that confusion about this issue can be cleared up. We also discuss the causes of dependence, so that the dependence relationship between any two diversity components in both partitioning schemes can be rigorously justified by theory and also intuitively understood by simulation. For the second issue, both multiplicative and additive beta diversities based on Hill numbers are useful measures and quantify different aspects of communities. However, neither can be directly applied to compare relative compositional similarity or differentiation across multiple regions with different numbers of communities because multiplicative beta diversity depends on the number of communities, and additive beta diversity additionally depends on alpha (equivalently, on gamma). Such dependences should be removed. We propose transformations to remove these dependences, and we show that the transformed multiplicative beta and additive beta both lead to the same classes of measures, which are always in a range of [0, 1] and thus can be used to compare relative similarity or differentiation among communities across multiple regions. These similarity measures include multiple-community generalizations of the S\o renson, Jaccard, Horn, and Morisita-Horn measures. For the third issue, we present some observations including a finding about which alpha formula produces independent alpha and beta components. These may help to resolve the choice of a proper formula for alpha diversity. Some related issues are also briefly discussed.},
