# IV. Beta diversity    
Split by components or by taxonomy?  
How does this square with small range sizes? How is nestedness so high?  

## i. Subfamily  
### Total beta diversity  
### Turnover vs Nestedness  
### Differences among mountain types/climates?  
  
## ii. Genus  
### Total beta diversity  
U, I, flat (but flat maybe a U). 
Mostly U or truncated U with a dip at middle elevations.  
  
### Turnover vs Nestedness  
Nestedness is often U-shaped, highest at the base and peak. 
Nestedness makes up a larger component at most elevations along most transects. 
Turnover is generally low, but somewhat variable.  
  
### Differences among mountain types/climates?  
  
## iii. Species  
### Total beta diversity  
U, I, flat. 
Mostly U-shaped though. 
Opposite of ecotone expectations - generally low at middle elevations.  

### Turnover vs Nestedness  
Nestedness is often U-shaped, highest at the base and peak. 
Nestedness is highest at high elevations - environmental filtering? 
Turnover is more variable: D, LP, HP, MP, I, U.  

### Differences among mountain types/climates?  
  
## iv. Comparison across taxonomic levels (spp vs gen)   
### All are generally higher at the spp than gen level  
Beta decreases as taxonomic resolution decreases. 
Turnover drops heavily, esp at sf level.  

### Several sites where turnover is much higher  
### Anything consistent?
