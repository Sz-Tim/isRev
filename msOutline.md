# III. Taxonomic patterns  
## Subfamilies  
### Diversity of subfamilies  
### Diversity within subfamilies  
### Diversity of most-speciose subfamily vs rest  
  
## Genera  
### Diversity of genera  
### Diversity within genera  
### Diversity of most-speciose genus vs rest 
  
## Species  
### Well-sampled vs poorly sampled  
  
  
    
# IV. Beta diversity    
\\ Split by components or by taxonomy?  
## Subfamily  
### Total beta diversity  
### Turnover vs Nestedness  
### Differences among mountain types/climates?  
  
## Genus  
### Total beta diversity  
### Turnover vs Nestedness  
### Differences among mountain types/climates?  
  
## Species  
### Total beta diversity  
### Turnover vs Nestedness  
### Differences among mountain types/climates?  
  
## Comparison across taxonomic levels (spp vs gen)  
### All are generally higher at the spp than gen level  
### Several sites where turnover is much higher  
### Anything consistent?
