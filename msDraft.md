## Literature search  
To identify ant elevational diversity datasets at local spatial scales, I performed a literature search with Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar, using combinations of the keywords 'ant', 'elevation*', 'altitud*', 'gradient', 'diversity', and 'insect'. 
This search primarily returned studies along discrete elevational transects with sampling sites interspersed along the gradient. 
To identify ant elevational diversity datasets at regional spatial scales, I searched for publications with 'ants of' in the title. 
This search returned guides to the ant fauna of a particular geopolitical region. 
Such guides typically compile museum records and collections from many years spread across the region, detailing the recorded occurrences of each ant species in the region. 
The elevational range of each ant species was estimated by the lowest and highest occurrence.
