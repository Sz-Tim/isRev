Review ideas for *Insectes Sociaux*   
===================================  
#####Created 2015 Feb 19  
#####Tim Szewczyk  
  
Two options for submission:  
- Submitted by the end of March, published in the summer  
- Submitted by the end of May, published at the end of the year  
  
Need to check with Mike Breed about:  
- Length and scope  
	- How broad?  
	- Recent reviews look like more summary than new analysis - das stimmt?  
	- How many pages?  
	- How many figures?  
	- Better to focus on one main aspect below? Or sample from several broad categories?   
	- Should I discuss diversity hypotheses?  

#### Taxonomy  
- Does each subfamily show the same pattern along a given gradient?  
- Do subfamilies show consistent patterns across gradients?  
- How does the number of genera change?  
- How does average elevational range size vary among subfamilies?    
  
#### Natural history   
- For tropical gradients, what are the patterns of arboreal vs ground ants?  
- Does average colony size change with elevation?  
- Does worker body size change with elevation? (size classes?)  
- Does feeding strategy change along elevational gradients?  
	- Predatory vs seed harvesting vs omnivores etc  
		- Stable isotope studies (Moony, Tillberg)  
	- At the genus level even?  
- Split species into small, medium, large range sizes; look at div patterns  
- Reproductive flights (Dunn et al 2007, Kaspari et al 2001 & 2001)  
- Reproductive strategies  
  
   
  
### Feasible for end of March:  
#### Option 1: Rework currently rejected-with-invitation-to-submit paper   
- Not much on behavior currently  
- Focus is on assessing factors that shape diversity   
- Revise to focus less on diversity hypotheses, more on taxonomic patterns  
  
**Pros:**   
- Would actually get this stupid thing over with  
- Would be quick and it needs to be out quickly  
- Wouldn't have to respond line-by-line to reviewers  
- Could still do a second paper on same dataset...  
  
**Cons:**  
- Lower impact journal  
- Readership is more insect-focused than macroecology-focused, so might not be as suitable  
   
  
### Feasible for end of May:
#### Option 2: Second paper that doesn't test diversity hypotheses, but describes patterns more thoroughly  
- Does each subfamily show the same pattern along a given gradient?  
- Do subfamilies show consistent patterns across gradients?  
- How does the number of genera change?  
- How does average elevational range size vary among subfamilies?  
- Split species into small, medium, large range sizes; look at diversity patterns  
- For tropical gradients, what are the patterns of arboreal vs ground ants?  
- Does feeding strategy (maybe generalized at the genus level) change along elevational gradients?  
  
**Pros:**  
- Two papers instead of one  
- Could more fully address and explore additional aspects  
- Incorporating more biology/taxonomy would make a better fit for *IS*  
  
**Cons:**  
- Two papers instead of one  
- Much more work this semester; ant ID's would be delayed  
- Would have to still respond line-by-line to reviewers
